name: haven

## Global Social Data

### Includes data from including the CIA World Factbook, the World Bank, the Association of Religion Data Archives, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the International Centre for Prison Studies, and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

- Let's imagine this data represents our population
- We want to identify the mean percentage of women holding national office.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("haven")
library(haven); library(dplyr)
url <- "https://ismayc.github.io/global13sdss_0.sav"
global13_full <- read_sav(url)
global13 <- global13_full %>% select(country, FEMALEOFFICE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
#install.packages(haven)
library(haven); library(dplyr)
url <- "https://ismayc.github.io/global13sdss_0.sav"
global13_full <- read_sav(url)
global13 <- global13_full %>% select(country, FEMALEOFFICE)
```


---

## Plotting the population data

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = global13, mapping = aes(x = FEMALEOFFICE)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 15)
```

---


## Sampling

- Let's use **sampling** to produce an estimate of the population mean
- Let's choose a sample of size 25

```{r}
library(mosaic); set.seed(2017)
sample1 <- global13 %>% resample(size = 25, replace = FALSE)
(mean_s1_f <- sample1 %>% summarize(mean_f = mean(FEMALEOFFICE)))
```

--

- But this is just one sample?  We could produce many samples with different means.  Which one is correct?

---

## Sampling distribution

```{r cache=TRUE}
sample_means <- do(5000) * 
  global13 %>% resample(size = 25, replace = FALSE) %>% 
  summarize(mean_f = mean(FEMALEOFFICE))
sample_means
```

---

## Plot of sampling distribution

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = sample_means, mapping = aes(x = mean_f)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 15)
```

---

name: meanofmeans

## Mean of the sampling distribution

### The mean of the sampling distribution of means (where the sampling distribution is centered) provides an estimate for our population mean:

```{r}
sample_means %>% summarize(mean_samp_dist = mean(mean_f))
```

--

### Population mean

```{r}
global13 %>% summarize(pop_mean = mean(FEMALEOFFICE))
```

---

name: stderror

## Standard deviation of the sampling distribution

### The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means (also known as the <u>standard error</u>) provides an estimate of how much variability we can expect in the means as we go from one sample to another.

```{r}
sample_means %>% summarize(std_error = sd(mean_f))
```

---

## How could we improve our estimate of the population mean?

--
- Increase the sample size
--

- Run more simulations (Instead of `do()`ing 5000 we could `do()` 100,000, for example)

---

## What if we didn't have the whole population?

--

### We could <u>resample</u> one randomly selected sample multiple times to create a guess to what the sampling distribution might look like.
--

### Important note:  This "guess" is called the <u>bootstrap distribution</u> and it is an approximation of the sampling distribution.
--

### The <u>bootstrap distribution</u> will always be centered near the original sample statistic so it is better used as an estimate of the shape of the sampling distribution and as an estimate of the standard error, but NOT as an estimate for the population center.

---

## Bootstrap our original sample

- Let's use our original sample from `global13` which we called `sample1`.
- Let's look to see what one such `resample()` of `sample1` gives us:

```{r}
set.seed(2017)
(boot1 <- sample1 %>% resample(orig.id = TRUE))
```

---

## Computing the bootstrap mean

```{r}
boot1 %>% summarize(boot_mean = mean(FEMALEOFFICE))
```

---

## Repeating this process

### Repeating this process over and over again, we can create a <u>bootstrap distribution</u> from the means of the <u>bootstrap samples</u>.

```{r cache=TRUE}
boot_means <- do(5000) * 
  sample1 %>% resample(orig.id = TRUE) %>% 
  summarize(boot_mean = mean(FEMALEOFFICE))
```

---

## Plotting the bootstrap distribution

```{r fig.height=5.5}
ggplot(data = boot_means, mapping = aes(x = boot_mean)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 15)
```

---

## Using the bootstrap distribution 

### To estimate the <u>standard error</u>

```{r}
boot_means %>% summarize(sd_boot_dist = sd(boot_mean))
```

---

## Using the bootstrap distribution

### To estimate the population mean

```{r}
boot_means %>% summarize(mean_boot_dist = mean(boot_mean))
```
--

- Hmm, that number looks familiar

```{r}
sample1 %>% summarize(sample_mean = mean(FEMALEOFFICE))
```

- What potential problems do we have with this estimate?


---

# Providing a better estimate

<img src="figure/spear.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 370px;"/>  |  <img src="figure/net.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 370px;"/>

---

## Confidence Interval

- A range of plausible values for a population parameter
- Built using bootstrapping and percentiles of the bootstrap distribution

```{r}
( ciq_mean <- confint(boot_means, level = 0.95, method = "quantile") )
```

### What does this mean?
--

- Using a method that is 95% reliable, our range of plausible values for the true mean percentage of women holding national office is between around 14.6% to 24.8%. 
---

## How did we fair using this sample?

#### True population mean

```{r}
global13 %>% summarize(pop_mean = mean(FEMALEOFFICE))
```

#### Confidence interval

```{r}
ciq_mean
```
--

- Would all random samples produce confidence intervals that include the population mean?  If not, what percentage would you expect to?

---

## Summary

- This activity was meant to show you how the concepts of **sampling** and **resampling** interact
--

- Bootstrapping works by allowing us to create a guess as to what the sampling distribution looks like.
    - This allows us to test hypotheses and create confidence intervals on unknown population values.
    - It also allows us to not necessarily worry about formulas and mathematical probability.
--
- It does still require us to have a random sample from our population as our **original sample** though.  *Why is that?*

---

name: ciprob

## Reason to be concerned

- Remember that the original population distribution was right-skewed.  Therefore, the mean doesn't make sense as a measure and may be causing some problems.

- <u>Problem</u>:  Repeat the **sampling**, **bootstrapping**, and **confidence interval** R code steps above, but this time using the median and the IQR instead of the mean and standard deviation.

---

## For PS13 (Due at the beginning of class on Tuesday)

- Can be hand-written or shared as a Google Doc
- Run the necessary code in an R script and explain your results from the Problem on the last slide.
    - Provide your modified code and explain what each line of code is doing.
    - What changes in the results of the analysis?  
    - Do we get the same result as with the mean and standard deviation?
- Read the article about [Margin of Errors and Polling](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/) from Pew
    - In two to three paragraphs, summarize the article and discuss how confidence intervals are useful in polling.

# Week 13 - Tuesday

# April 25, 2017
---

class: center, middle

## Warmup - Your answer should be 3-6 sentences.

### Discuss the importance of the "simulated data" step in the "There is Only One Test" framework.  Why is it needed?  What does it accomplish?  

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/ht.png")
```

---

# Go over the "There is Only One Test" for Two Sample Independent problem

### Average income varies from one region of the country to another, and it often reflects both lifestyles and regional living expenses. Suppose a new graduate is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and he wants to see whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other. He would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on two randomly selected samples from the 2000 Census.

# [Inference Mind-map](https://coggle.it/diagram/Vxlydu1akQFeqo6-)

---

# Work through the problem in [R via R Markdown](http://ismayc.github.io/teaching/sample_problems/two-means-indep.html)

- Skip the Confidence Interval parts (that's Chapter 8)

---

### How would this change if we were looking to potentially move to Seattle and Boston as well as Sacramento and Cleveland?

--

### This is called an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test

- It compares the variability in the sample means to the variability in the samples (Analyzes the variance)

---

## Chi-square test

- The extension of a two sample proportion test is a chi-square test

### A random sample of 500 U.S. adults were questioned regarding their political affiliation (Democrat or Republican) and opinion on a tax reform bill (favor, indifferent, opposed). Based on this sample, do we have reason to believe that opinion on the bill can predict whether or not a respondent is a Democrat?

- Here a success is "being a Democrat"
- We want to test <small> $H_0: \pi_{favor} = \pi_{indiff} = \pi_{opp}$ </small> versus <small> $H_A:$ </small> at least one of the proportions is different

# So when are the assumptions violated for traditional tests?

# Why should we use randomization methods instead?

x2 <- (900 - x1) * sd2 + 80000

x1[length(x1) - 1] <- 68828.67
x1[length(x1)] <- 50015.23
skewed <- data_frame(x1, x2) %>%
  rename(`1` = x1, `2` = x2) %>%
  gather(key = "group", value = "value")
```

```{r fig.height=5.3}
ggplot(data = skewed, mapping = aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

### We collect a sample of 20 from each

```{r}
set.seed(2017)
my_sample <- skewed %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  sample_n(20) %>%
  ungroup()
ggplot(data = my_sample, mapping = aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~group, scales = "free_x")
```

---

### A different plot

```{r fig.height=5.5}
ggplot(data = my_sample, mapping = aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

### We calculate the observed sample mean

```{r}
(my_means <- my_sample %>% group_by(group) %>% 
  summarize(my_mean = mean(value)))
(obs_diff <- diff(my_means$my_mean))
```

---

### But what if we had collected a different sample instead <br> (assuming <small> $H_0$ </small> is true)

```{r}
library(mosaic)
(shuffled_my_means <- my_sample %>%
     mutate(value = shuffle(value)) %>% 
     group_by(group) %>%
     summarize(my_mean_shuf = mean(value)))
(obs_shuf_diff <- diff(shuffled_my_means$my_mean_shuf))
```

---

### And repeated this many times

```{r eval=FALSE}
many_shuffles <- do(5000) *
(shuffled_my_means <- my_sample %>%
     mutate(value = shuffle(value)) %>% 
     group_by(group) %>%
     summarize(my_mean_shuf = mean(value)))
rand_distn <- many_shuffles %>% 
  group_by(.index) %>% 
  summarize(diffmean = diff(my_mean_shuf))
```

---

### And plotted the null distribution

```{r fig.height=5, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(rand_distn, aes(x = diffmean)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20)
```

<center>
<img src="figure/Rplot.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 330px;" />
</center>

- This is not represented well by a bell-shaped curve

---

# Moral of the story

- Randomization methods will always work
- Traditional methods will usually work, but with skewed distributions they can produce invalid/questionable results
- It's usually good to run both types and compare them

## Hypothesis Testing in General

### The **how** of these 3 points may change, but the **what** doesn't:

1. Identify the test statistic
--

2. Construct the null distribution of the test statistic based on the null hypothesis
--

3. Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to compute the **p-value**

---

## Specifics 1: Test Statistic

We can do hypothesis testing for lots of different scenarios

Type  | Population Parameter | Test Statistic
------------- | ------------- | -------------
One-Sample  | Mean <br> $\mu$ | Sample Mean <br> $\overline{x}$
One-Sample  | Proportion <br> $\pi$ | Sample Proportion <br> $\widehat{p}$
Two-Sample (Independent) &nbsp; | Diff of Population Means <br> $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ | Diff of Sample Means <br> $\overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2$
Two-Sample (Paired) | Mean Population Difference <br> $\mu_{diff}$ | Mean Sample Difference <br> $\overline{x}_{diff}$
Two-Sample  | Diff of Population Proportions <br> $\pi_1 - \pi_2$ | Diff of Sample Proportions <br> $\widehat{p}_1 - \widehat{p}_2$

We'll discuss more advanced procedures (ANOVA and Chi-Square) on Tuesday.

---

## Specifics 2: Null Distribution

### We can construct the null distribution of the test statistic either

* Via computation i.e. simulation/shuffling
    - Ex: We used the **Permutation Test** i.e. we permuted things
* Via mathematics i.e. analytically
    - Ex: Traditionally via Probability using the **Central Limit Theorem**: $\overline{X}$ is Normally distributed as $n \rightarrow \infty$
- **Note**: the null distribution isn't always bell shaped! i.e. not always Normal

---

## Specifics 3: _p_-value

### For Two-Sample Independent tests, we have either

### Two-sided _p_-values

+ Two-tailed: $H_A: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} \neq 0$

--

### One-sided _p_-values
--

+ Left-tailed: $H_A: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} < 0$
--

+ Right-tailed: $H_A: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} > 0$
---

## Moral of the Story

### If you forget what hypothesis testing and/or _p_-values are remember:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=16/2, fig.height=3.5}
library(mosaic)
simulation <- do(10000) * rflip(10)
ggplot(simulation, aes(x = heads)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Number of Guesses Correct") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 9, color = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)
```

- For this example (from this plot), since our observed results are far from what we expect, we reject our original "by chance" assumption in favor of the research hypothesis.

# Split into groups of 3-4

### For each of the following five problems BEFORE trying to identify which type of problem it is, identify 

- the variables of interest,
- the types of variables they are,
- and the observational units

### AFTER identifying the problem type for each of the five problems, start to layout what the null and alternative hypotheses are in symbols.

---

## Identify the type of problem:

### **Types**:  One Mean, One Proportion, Two Means (Independent), Two Means (Paired), Two Proportions

###  **Problem 1**:  Average income varies from one region of the country to another, and it often reflects both lifestyles and regional living expenses. Suppose a new graduate is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and he wants to see whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other. He would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on two randomly selected samples from the 2000 Census.

---

## Identify the type of problem:

### **Types**:  One Mean, One Proportion, Two Means (Independent), Two Means (Paired), Two Proportions

### **Problem 2**:  A 2010 survey asked 827 randomly sampled registered voters in California "Do you support? Or do you oppose? Drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California? Or do you not know enough to say?" Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the data provide strong evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do not have an opinion on this issue is different than that of non-college graduates.

---

## Identify the type of problem:

### **Types**:  One Mean, One Proportion, Two Means (Independent), Two Means (Paired), Two Proportions

### **Problem 3**: The CEO of a large electric utility claims that 80 percent of his 1,000,000 customers are satisfied with the service they receive. To test this claim, the local newspaper surveyed 100 customers, using simple random sampling. 73 were satisfied and the remaining were unsatisfied.  Based on these findings from the sample, can we reject the CEO's hypothesis that 80% of the customers are satisfied?

---

## Identify the type of problem:

### **Types**:  One Mean, One Proportion, Two Means (Independent), Two Means (Paired), Two Proportions

### **Problem 4**: The National Survey of Family Growth conducted by the Centers for Disease Control gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men's and women's health. One of the variables collected on this survey is the age at first marriage. 5,534 randomly sampled US women between 2006 and 2010 completed the survey. The women sampled here had been married at least once.  Do we have evidence that the mean age of first marriage for all US women from 2006 to 2010 is greater than 23 years?

---

## Identify the type of problem:

### **Types**:  One Mean, One Proportion, Two Means (Independent), Two Means (Paired), Two Proportions

### **Problem 5**: Trace metals in drinking water affect the flavor and an unusually high concentration can pose a health hazard. Ten pairs of data were taken measuring zinc concentration in bottom water and surface water at 10 randomly selected locations on a stretch of river. Do the data suggest that the true average concentration in the surface water is smaller than that of bottom water? (Note that units are not given.)

## County Characteristics Datasets

### Annual County Resident Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin

- Downloaded from [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2015/counties/asrh/) via <br> <small> `cc-est2015-alldata.csv` </small>
- Codebook is available [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2015/counties/asrh/cc-est2015-alldata.pdf)
- This dataset is NOT **tidy**.  I've tidied it and focused on only Total Population and Black or African American alone.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Remember to load the needed packages
library(dplyr)
library(mosaic)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

## Hypothesis Testing

### Comparing mean percentages in two states

- Suppose we were interested in testing the mean percentage of black residents in two different states.  Let's choose Oregon and Washington.
- Washington has 39 counties and Oregon has 36.
- Assume we only have access to 20 randomly selected counties from each state.

```{r eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://ismayc.github.io/wash-or_black.csv"
wash_or <- readr::read_csv(url) 
```

```{r include=FALSE}
wash_or <- read_csv("data/wash-or_black.csv")
```

---

## Problem set-up

### Do we have evidence that the mean percentage of black residents in Washington and Oregon is statistically different?

- What's the alternative hypothesis?
--

    - <small> $H_A: \mu_{wa} \ne \mu_{or}$ or $H_A: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} \ne 0$ </small>
    
- What is the null hypothesis?
--

    - <small> $H_0: \mu_{wa} = \mu_{or}$ or $H_0: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} = 0$ </small>

---

## The Hypotheses

- $H_0: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} = 0$ 
- $H_A: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} \ne 0$

### What do these mean in laymen terms?

--

- We are assuming that the mean percentage of black residents in Washington and Oregon is THE SAME.
- We will use hypothesis testing to look to see if we have evidence to go against this assumption in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

---

class: center, middle

## The layout of all hypothesis tests

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/ht.png", dpi = 120)
```

---

## For our problem

### What is the *observational unit*?

```{r echo=FALSE}
wash_or %>% arrange(county) %>% select(county, state, black_perc) %>% 
                     sample_n(5) %>%
                     knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
--

<br>

- Counties in Washington and Oregon
---

## DATA:  

- We have collected our sample of 20 Washington counties and 20 Oregon counties

--

## TEST STATISTIC:  

- We are interested in the difference in sample means.

---

## OBSERVED EFFECT

```{r}
(state_means <- wash_or %>% group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(mean_perc = mean(black_perc)))
(obs_diff <- diff(state_means$mean_perc))
```

- From our original (observed) sample, we have 

### $$\verb+obs_diff+ = \bar{x}_{wa} - \bar{x}_{or} = `r obs_diff`$$

---

## MODEL OF <small> $H_0$ </small>

### We assume that the two POPULATION mean percentages are the same:

- $H_0: \mu_{wa} = \mu_{or}$ <br> or <br> $H_0: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} = 0$

- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE:  Remember that PARAMETERS go in hypotheses NOT statistics!

---

## SIMULATED DATA 

### We want to use the data we have collected to simulate a process following the model for $H_0$.
--

### *BIG STEP* :  Assuming that <small> $H_0: \mu_{wa} = \mu_{or}$ </small>, any one of the percentages we saw in our sample data could have occurred (equally) in either Washington or in Oregon.

--

### We can use the `shuffle` function in the `mosaic` package to shuffle the percentages between Oregon and Washington.

---

## One shuffle

```{r}
set.seed(2016)
(shuffled_state_means <- wash_or %>%
     mutate(black_perc = shuffle(black_perc)) %>% 
     group_by(state) %>%
     summarize(mean_shuf_perc = mean(black_perc)))
(obs_shuf_diff <- diff(shuffled_state_means$mean_shuf_perc))
```

---

## NULL DISTRIBUTION

- Repeat this shuffling many times and then look at the distribution of all the resulting simulated test statistics

```{r cache=TRUE}
many_shuffles <- do(5000) *
  (shuffled_state_means <- wash_or %>%
     mutate(black_perc = shuffle(black_perc)) %>% 
     group_by(state) %>%
     summarize(mean_shuf_perc = mean(black_perc)))
rand_distn <- many_shuffles %>% 
  group_by(.index) %>% 
  summarize(diffmean = diff(mean_shuf_perc))
```

---

### Plot of NULL DISTRIBUTION

```{r fig.height=3.2}
ggplot(rand_distn, aes(x = diffmean)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20)
```
- Where will the center of this distribution always be for tests of this sort?
--

    - 0 (We assumed the means were the same & used that process to build the distribution).

---

## View the _p_-value

### We want to see where our observed effect (the original different in sample means) falls on our NULL DISTRIBUTION.

- Note that we check for both directions here since we had a two-sided <small> $H_A$. </small>

```{r fig.height=2.7}
ggplot(rand_distn, aes(x = diffmean,
                      fill = (abs(diffmean) >= obs_diff))) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20)
```

---

## View the $p$-value

```{r fig.height=5}
 ggplot(data = rand_distn, aes(x = diffmean)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_diff, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -obs_diff, color = "red")
```

---

## Calculate the _p_-value

```{r}
pvalue <- rand_distn %>%
  filter(abs(diffmean) >= obs_diff) %>%
  nrow() / nrow(rand_distn)
pvalue
```

### So there is around a `r round(pvalue * 100)`%  chance we could have seen results such as this (or MORE EXTREME) if the true population mean percentages were the same.  What does that mean?

---

## Significance level

- The "beyond a reasonable doubt" in statistics corresponds to setting the $\alpha$ value before you conduct your test.  Most often this is set to 5%.

- So with our test, since `r pvalue` > 0.05, we fail to reject <small> $H_0$ </small> in favor of <small> $H_A$ </small>.  

- We DO NOT have evidence to support the claim that the mean percentages of black residents per county are different for Washington and Oregon.

---

## All data

- The 2015 data for ALL counties is available via:

```{r}
cc_full <- read_csv("http://ismayc.github.io/cc_full.csv")
```

- Practice:  Determine what the actual difference is in mean percentage of black residents for ALL Washington and Oregon counties using code similar to what we did earlier.  

- Is the difference **practically** large?

```{r include=FALSE}
cc_full %>% filter(state %in% c("Oregon", "Washington")) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(mean_perc = mean(black_perc))
```

---

# Week 11 - Thursday

# Review Midterm Exam

- Here are the [solutions](Midterm_ExamKey.pdf)

---

# RStudio Tools

### All hail the <small>`mosaic`</small> package. Load as usual: <small>`library(mosaic)`</small>

### The following four functions will give us (most of) the random simulation tools we need:

1. `rflip()`: Flip a coin
1. `shuffle()`: Shuffle a set of values (akin to cards)
1. `do()`: Do the same thing many, many, many times
1. `resample()`: the swiss army knife of functions

---

## R Simulations Example

### First load up RStudio

- Create new R script file, type the following commands (not the comments), and run them in your R Console

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Load packages, including mosaic package
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(mosaic)
# Flip a coin once. Try this multiple times:
rflip()
```

---

## R Simulations Example

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Flip a coin 10 times. Try this multiple times:
rflip(10)
```

---

## R Simulations Example

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Flip a coin 10 times, but do this 5 times. Try this multiple times
do(5) * rflip(10)
```

---

## R Simulations Example

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Flip a coin 10 times, but do this 5000 times
do(5000) * rflip(10)
```

---

## R Simulations Example

```{r cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Gah! There are too many rows!
simulations <- do(5000) * rflip(10)
```
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# We could also View() it
View(simulations)
```

---

## R Simulations Example

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=5}
# Plot our resulting proportions
ggplot(data = simulations, aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = "white")
```

---

## R Simulations Example

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=5}
# Plot our resulting proportions
ggplot(data = simulations, mapping = aes(x = factor(prop))) +
  geom_bar()
```


---


## Shuffling AKA Permuting

Shuffling AKA re-ordering AKA **permuting** are all synonyms. I'm going to use
all three terms interchangeably. 

Type the following code into your R script:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
# Define a vector fruit
fruit <- c("apple", "orange", "mango")

# Do this multiple times:
shuffle(fruit)
```

---


## Shuffling AKA Permuting

This works with the `do()` operator...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
do(5) * shuffle(fruit)
```

... as well as within a `mutate()`



```{r, eval=FALSE}
example_data <- data_frame(
  name = c("Ilana", "Abbi", "Hannibal"),
  fruit = c("apple", "orange", "mango")
)

# Run this multiple times: 
example_data %>% mutate(fruit = shuffle(fruit))
```

---

## Key Distinction

### A *huge* distinction in types of sampling:

1. Sampling **with** replacement
1. Sampling **without** replacement

---

## Resampling

### At its most basic, `resample()` resamples the input vector **with** replacement. Run this in the console multiple times from your R script:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
resample(fruit)
```

* You can get the same fruit all three times i.e. sampling with replacement
* `resample()` has default settings that we can set to fit our needs; it is a swiss army knife.
* Let's unpack the defaults:

---


## Resampling

```{r, eval=FALSE}
resample(x = fruit, size = length(x), replace = TRUE, 
         prob = rep(1 / length(x), times = length(x)) )
```

* <small>`x`</small> is the input. In this case <small>`fruit`</small>.
* <small>`size`</small>: size of output vector. By default the same size as <small>`x`</small>.
* <small>`replace`</small>: Sample **with** or **without** replacement. By default with replacement.
* <small>`prob`</small>: Probability of sampling each input value. By default, equal probability
* Run the following.  What does it do?

```{r eval=FALSE}
rep(1/length(fruit), times = length(fruit))
```

---

## Scenario for Today

* Say you are a statistician and you meet someone called the "Lady Tasting Tea."
* She claims she can tell by tasting whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup.
--

* You want to test whether
    + She can actually tell which came first **OR**
    + She's lying and is only guessing at random
--
* Say you have just enough tea/milk to pour into 10 cups.

---

## Lady Tasting Tea

* Lady Tasting Tea claims she can tell if tea or milk was poured first into a cup
* You run an experiment with 10 cups if she can tell or if she is bullshitting
* Let's _assume a hypothetical world where she is guessing at random_.

---

## Lady Tasting Tea

### If guessing at random, here are the *hypothetical* outcomes:

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.height=5.5}
simulation <- do(5000) * rflip(10)
ggplot(simulation, aes(x = heads)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x="Number of Guesses Correct")
```

---

## Lady Tasting Tea

She got 9/10 right!

```{r, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(simulation, aes(x = heads)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Number of Guesses Correct") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 9, color = "red")
```

---

## Lady Tasting Tea

She got 9/10 right!

```{r, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(simulation, aes(x = heads)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Number of Guesses Correct") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 9, color = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)
```

---

## Lady Tasting Tea

* In our hypothetical world of guessing at random, 9/10 OR MORE occured 
`r sum(simulation$heads == 9) + sum(simulation$heads == 10)` times out of `r nrow(simulation)`. i.e. <br>
`r round(100*(sum(simulation$heads == 9) + sum(simulation$heads == 10))/nrow(simulation), 3)`% of the time. 
* Can she tell, or is she bullshitting?

# Warmup - Similar to Old Exam Question

What `dplyr` and `ggplot2` code is needed to produce the following plot using the `gapminder` data set?  (You can assume `library()` has already been run on all needed packages.) *Hint*:  You should use the `%in%` operator.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
country_list <- c("Guatemala", "Uganda", "Ethiopia", "Bangladesh")
six_countries <- gapminder %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% country_list)
ggplot(data = six_countries, 
  aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

What stands out to you from a social perspective as you observe this graph?

---

## Goals for the course going forward

- Focus on understanding how data visualization and data wrangling play a role in inference
- Discuss FiveThirtyEight articles from a social perspective while also relating back to statistical content
- Work on summarizing important content and giving you a better sense of what to expect
- What I need from you
  - More questions!  I can't know what you don't understand unless you ask.
  - Focus on testing for your own understanding and speaking up when something needs more explanation

---

## Today: Switching Gears

* We've covered **Tidy**, **Visualize**, and **Transform** 
* Start with **Model**
* The focus throughout is on **Communicate**.

<img src="figure/pipeline.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 700px;" border="1"/>

---

## Key Definitions

### Let's ask our favorite search engine:

* Define inference
* Define **statistical** inference

---

# Sampling

## Match the term to its correct definition

- Carefully read over the [worksheet](sampling.pdf) individually
- Complete the [worksheet](sampling.pdf) individually
- Then pair up with two or three new people from class that you haven't worked with before to
go over your answers


---

## The Paradigm for the Rest of the Class

<img src="figure/target-population.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 700px;" border="1"/>

---

- <small><small>Identify the **population** of interest and the **population parameter**</small></small>
- <small><small>Identify the **sample** used and the **statistic**</small></small>
- <small><small>Comment on the **generalizability** of the results of the sample to the population.</small></small>

***

- <small><small>You want to understand the income of Pacific University graduates in the last 10 years.  You get the records of 10 randomly chosen Pacific graduates.  You take the median of their answers.</small></small>
- <small><small>Imagine it's 1993 i.e. almost all households have landlines.  You want to know the average number of people in each household in Forest Grove.  You randomly pick out 500 numbers from the phone book & conduct a phone survey.</small></small>
- <small><small>You want to know the prevalence (i.e. proportion) of illegal downloading of TV shows among Pacific University students.  You get the emails of 100 randomly chosen Pacific University students and ask them "How many times did you download a pirated TV show last week?"</small></small>

## Visualizing Sampling

### OkCupid Self-reported Heights from [ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/6-sim.html#visualizing-sampling)


- [Shiny app to better understand the role of sampling](https://ismay.shinyapps.io/okcupidheights/)

---

## Recall

* **Random** sampling: where we select the sample from the population in an unbiased fashion
* Bias: A sample is biased if some observations have a higher **probability** of being
included in the sample. 

> * Keywords: **random** and **probability**

--

* In short: Probability is the study of randomness.
* Its roots lie in one [historical constant](https://www.google.com/search?q=probability&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnvJG7_oTQAhVIQiYKHSQ7CnoQ_AUICSgC&biw=2559&bih=1316&dpr=2#newwindow=1&tbm=isch&q=history+of+gambling).

## Two Approaches to Probability

There are two approaches to studying probability:

Mathematically             |  Simulations
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="figure/pdf.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>  |  <img src="figure/coin.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>

> * **Note**: The "random simulation" in question is not limited to coin flips.

---


## Two Approaches to Probability

- The mathematical approach to studying probability requires more mathematical background: set theory, discrete math, calculus, and later on measure theory.
--

- The simulation approach does not.
--

- Instead we require a computer's **random number generator** to generate simulations. Why?

---


## Simulations via Computer

Doing this repeatedly by hand is tiring:

# [Problem Set 9 Assignment for Thursday](http://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/problem-sets/index.html#ps9)

- Due at the end of the day (11:59 PM on Thursday)
- You will be peer reviewing a Group Project assigned to you
- You'll also be including (Helpful for Midterm Exam)
  - an updated plot using `ggplot2`
  - a `dplyr` wrangling task to summarize the `fivethirtyeight` data frame used in the vignette
- This will give you practive with `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `rmarkdown` while (hopefully)
ensuring that you can perform the tasks asked of you in the group project individually.

# Jazzing up your Group Project plots

- Make sure to add labels to your axes and a title to your plot via
`labs(x = , y = , title = )`.  
  - Remember to use the `+` to add labs/themes to your plot
just like you do with `geom_`etries

---

# Jazzing up your Group Project plots


- Think about using `theme_fivethirtyeight()` as I did in the `example_vignette.Rmd`.  
  - Note your need to install the `ggthemes` package and load it via `library(ggthemes)` in the top R Markdown chunk.
- Another option for cool themes of your plots is `theme_ipsum()` in the [`hrbrthemes` package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes)

# Warmup
--

1. How can I better address this feedback?  
    - "more of a social science aspect to the data we are using in our work."
2. "I was under the impression we were going to analyze data more than we have been."
    - What does 'analyzing data' mean to you?
3.  Why do I ask DataCamp questions over content we haven't explicitly covered?

---

# Comment

### "I wish there was a way for us to go over material with you if we had to miss class one day."
--

  - I'm happy to chat with you (even be it over video chat).  All it takes is you reaching out to me.
  - I'd encourage you to look over the slides first to better understand what you've missed and to do the reading assignment in the textbook before reaching out to me.  FoR Simulations Example, `geom_col` was discussed when we talked about [barplots](#geomcol).

---

# Work day!

- Look over my comments on your Group Project
  - Press the spellcheck button in R Markdown!
    ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

    ```
- Do [Problem Set 8](https://goo.gl/forms/tCBFF7cuMbYgPIyb2) 
- Finish [dplyr Review](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/dplyr-review-8) (Due today at 11:59 PM)
- Read [Chapter 6 of ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/6-sim.html)

### Write the code to produce the following table using ALL 5 of the 5MV functions in the `dplyr` package on the `gapminder` data frame in the `gapminder` R package.  
- Your code will be simplest if you use `|` in your `filter`.
- Notice how the data is sorted.

# Group Options

- If you want to work in a group of four, you can do so BUT you'll need to complete 2 unrelated vignettes.
--

- If you are left in a group of two, I will work with you to set up an assignment that is fair.
--

- Final decisions on group members MUST be made by the end of the day today.  I won't accept any changes in group members after today.
--

- If you have problems contacting your group members, please let me know on Slack as soon as possible.  **Check** SLACK at least once per day!


---


# Group Options

- If you are already having trouble setting up times to meet to work on the Group Project, you are going to have an even harder time going forward.
    - Pick a standard time to meet that works for everyone.
    - I would count a missed group meeting as a failing grade for the project.
--
- You will need to meet outside of class to complete this project.  This could easily include having a Google Hangout video chat as needed.  Further, if you set up tasks appropriately, you may not need to meet in person much.

---

# Set-up Google Drive on your computer

- Click on the link I sent you for your Group Project folder in your email or in the Slack message I sent to your group

    - https://www.google.com/drive/download/
--

- Open the Rproj file in the Google Drive folder on your computer
--

- Make sure that `script.R` opens with RStudio
--

- Try to Knit `group_project.Rmd`

---

# Group Project Deadlines

- Always check [the Group Project Outline](https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/group_project_outline/index.html) to make sure you are on schedule and more specific deadlines

- March 14 (2:45 PM) - Group Project Draft Due

- March 23 (10:00 AM) - Revised Group Project Due

# Data ~~Manipulation~~ Wrangling

## The `gapminder` data frame in the `gapminder` package

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
glimpse(gapminder)
```

---

## Base R versus the `tidyverse`

- Say we wanted mean life expectancy across all years for Asia
--

```{r}
# Base R
asia <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", ]
mean(asia$lifeExp)
```
--
 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
gapminder %>% filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(lifeExp))

---

## The pipe `%>%`

`r knitr::include_graphics("figure/pipe.png")` &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `r knitr::include_graphics("figure/MagrittePipe.jpg")`
--

- A way to chain together commands
--

- It is *essentially* the `dplyr` equivalent to the <br> `+` in `ggplot2`

---

# The 5NG of data viz
--

### `geom_point()`<br> `geom_line()` <br> `geom_histogram()`<br>  `geom_boxplot()`<br> `geom_bar()`

---
# The 5MV of data wrangling
### `filter()` <br> `summarize()` <br> `group_by()` <br> `mutate()` <br> `arrange()`

---

# `filter()`

- Allows you to select a subset of the rows of a data frame. 

- The arguments are the "filters" that you'd like to apply.
--

```{r}
library(gapminder); library(dplyr)
gap_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
head(gap_2007)
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `==` to compare a variable to a value
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(gapminder); library(dplyr)
gap_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year = 2007)
```

```
Error: filter() takes unnamed arguments. Do you need `==`?
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `|` to check for any in multiple filters being true:
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | continent == "Europe")
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | continent == "Europe")
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `&` or `,` to check for all of multiple filters being true:
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, continent == "Europe")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, continent == "Europe")
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `%in%` to check for any being true <br> (shortcut to using `|` repeatedly)
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Belgium", "Mexico"),
         year %in% c(1987, 1992))
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Belgium", "Mexico"),
         year %in% c(1987, 1992))
```


---

# `summarize()`

- Any numerical summary that you want to apply to a column of a data frame is specified within `summarize()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
max_exp_1997 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
max_exp_1997 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997
```



---

### Combining `summarize()` with `group_by()`

- When you'd like to determine a numerical summary for all
levels of a different categorical variable

```{r eval=FALSE}
max_exp_1997_by_cont <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
knitr::kable(max_exp_1997_by_cont, format = "html")
```

--
```{r echo=FALSE}
max_exp_1997_by_cont <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
knitr::kable(max_exp_1997_by_cont, format = "html")
```

# Warmup

What code is needed to produce this plot using the `na.omit(flying)` data frame derived from the `fivethirtyeight` package?  Make sure to load all needed libraries.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5.7, fig.width=11, fig.align='center'}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = na.omit(flying), mapping = aes(x = age, fill = recline_rude)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill", color = "white")
```


---

# `scale_fill_manual`

- We will use `scale_`s sparingly but they can be nice for customizing your plots more

    - You'll probably want to use them on your Group Project

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tibble)
numeric_var <- c(10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21)
hist_example <- data_frame(numeric_var)
hist_example

class <- factor(class, levels = c("Sophomore", "Junior", "Senior"))
class_df <- tibble::data_frame(class)
class_df
```

- Create a frequency table for this data on paper

---

- Sketch a plot based on this frequency table

--

2. Side-by-side barplot
--

3. Faceted barplot

4. Stacked proportional plot
  - Preferred if <br> number of groups in the second variable $\le 3$
  
---

## What code is needed to produce this plot?

- This is using the `profiles` data frame in the `okcupiddata` package.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

# Stacked barplot

- Uses `fill` to change the colors of the bars of the `x` variable based on the values of another variable
--

- What code is needed to produce this plot?

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = smokes))
```


---

# Side-by-side barplot

- Uses `position = "dodge"` to place the bars next to each other for each group of the `x` variable
--

- What code is needed to produce this plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11}
library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", mapping = aes(fill = smokes))
```

---

# Faceted barplot

- Uses `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` to make small multiples of the plot
--

- What code is needed to produce this plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11}
library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ smokes)
```

---

# Stacked proportional barplot

- Uses `position = "fill"` to show the percentage of the `fill` variable for each group of `x`
--

### Consider the following numerical data frame

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
numeric_var <- c(10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21)
hist_example <- data_frame(numeric_var)
hist_example

library(dplyr)
numeric_var <- c(10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21)
hist_example <- data_frame(numeric_var)
hist_example
```


- Place the data into two bins of size 6
- Then produce a table showing how many data points fall in each bin

---

### Sketch a plot of this frequency table

Bin     | Count
--------|-------
(9-15] | 4
(15-21] | 2

--

```{r fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = hist_example, mapping = aes(x = numeric_var)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 6, color = "black", fill = "white")
```

## Practice in pairs

- Write the code to produce a histogram of the humidity recordings in the [<small>`weather`</small> data frame](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html#weather) from the <small>`nycflights13`</small> package 
  - with a bin width of 15, 
  - white border color, and 
  - fill with the [color of your choosing](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).
- Practice in the DataCamp sandbox at <br> http://bit.ly/stats-sandbox

--

```{r include=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white", fill = "goldenrod")
```

- THINK ABOUT IT: What does this plot tell us?

---

# Faceting

- Oftentimes, we'd like to produce a small multiple of the same plot across the levels of a different variable. Suppose we'd like to look at the plot created on the last slide *across* the different <small>`origin`</small> airports.
--

  - Use the code given in Section 4.6 of [ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/4-viz.html#facets) and the plot you created on the last slide.
  - Write down your code on paper and test in the [sandbox](http://bit.ly/stats-sandbox)

```{r include=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white", fill = "goldenrod") +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ origin)
```
--

- THINK ABOUT IT: What does this faceted plot tell us?

---

# Faceting

- Write the code to produce the plot below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=11}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid, fill = origin)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ origin)
```

---

# Another way to <small>`facet`</small>

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=11}
library(nycflights13); library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid, fill = origin)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5, color = "white") + # NOTE bins here
  facet_grid(facets = origin ~ .)
```

---

# Explanatory and Response Variables

### Suppose we were interested in investigating the humidity throughout 2013 across the airports in NYC.

- What would be the explanatory and response variables?

- Note there is only one correct answer here.

---

# Boxplots

- Another way to view the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a numerical response variable is via a boxplot.  Think about how we might write the code to produce the boxplot for humidity across airports.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = origin, y = humid)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Why is tidy data important?

- Think about trying to plot total fertility across years in the simplest way possible with the data on [Warmup slide](#warmup).
--

- It would be much easier if the data looked like what follows instead so we could put <small>`year`</small> on the <small>`x`</small>-axis and <small>`fert`</small> on the <small>`y`</small>-axis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
total_fertility <- readr::read_csv("data/total_fertility.csv") 
colnames(total_fertility)[1] <- "country"
total_fertility <- total_fertility %>% 
  select(country, `1945`:`2015`) %>% 
  na.omit()
set.seed(3)
total_fert_tidy <- total_fertility %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>% 
  gather(-country, key = "year", value = "fert") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) 
total_fert_tidy %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

## Making a scatterplot

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert)) +
  geom_point()
```


---

## Discussing the scatterplot

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert)) +
  geom_point()
```

- What stands out to you as you look at this plot?
- What other information would be useful here?


---

## Identifying the countries

```{r echo=FALSE}
total_fert_tidy %>% distinct(country) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

--

- How could we identify the countries on the plot?
--

- This is another reason why *tidy data* is so valuable.  <br> Check this out!

## Looking only at 2007

- This code will be covered more in [Chapter 5 of ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/5-manip.html)


```{r}
library(dplyr)
gap2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
head(gap2007, n = 10)
```

---

## What code is needed to produce this plot?

- Write the code on paper and then discuss in groups of 3.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(data = gap2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

--

- There are `r nrow(total_fertility)` countries included here.  What would be a different/better way we could highlight points than by country
that would be of interest here?

---

## Coloring by `continent`

- Write the code on paper and then discuss in groups of 3.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = gap2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent))
```
--

- What information is added by the coloring here?

--

- What are good ways to practice programming without DataCamp?
--

- How do you format your exams?

---

# Questions/concerns about class

--

- I worry I don't actually know what I'm doing.
--

- More details about the project.
--

# Some clarifications

- Telling me early that you will be gone on a day in the future is NOT an excused absence
   - You can miss class three times for whatever you wish
   - You need institutional excuse to miss more than three
--

- Just doing the homework is not enough to build sufficient understanding
   - You need to go back over DataCamp, the Learning Checks, and the book on your own to check for understanding
   
---

# Some clarifications   
   
-  I'm not trying to scare you, but quizzes and exams will be HARD and you will struggle if you don't
follow what I am telling you.
  - If you follow the effective learning strategies I have shown you and devote yourself to practice, you'll do great AND you'll retain the material.
  - You'll find that you'll actually be studying LESS, since you won't have to re-learn all the material and cram for exams/quizzes.

## Tidy Data

## Is this tidy?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dem_score <- read_csv("data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```

---

## Beginning steps

### Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to
- check that the data is *tidy*,
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.
### This will help you with 
- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

<img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single *observational unit*
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the *observational units*. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be *observed values* associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

### This is just a spreadsheet! 

### But we are very strict about the previous three rules.

## Easy classes are worthless classes

- You won't retain any of the material covered
--

- You or someone else pays good money for you to get a good education here
--

- I want to do everything in my power to help you learn this material as I see it as THE MOST IMPORTANT class you can take as an undergraduate.
--

- You have many misconceptions about how you learn best.  That's not your fault, but habits must be broken.
--

- Can we build muscles sitting on the couch?

---

## Why are you learning R?

- R is free, R improves, R has existed for 40+ years
- You can show what you have learned to a potential employer easily
- I want to prepare you for the real world as best as I can and make you more employable than your competitors

---

## Why are you learning R?

- R will save you TONS of time in the long run. Long term thinking is key.
    - You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
    - Remembering what drop-down menu some thing is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
