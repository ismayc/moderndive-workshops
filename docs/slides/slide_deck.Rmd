## Important R ideas for students to know ASAP

Vector/variable
  - Type of vector (`int`, `num`, `chr`, `logical`, `date`)

--

Data frame
  - Vectors of (potentially) different types
  - Each vector has the same number of rows

## What is Tidy Data?

<img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 750px;"/>

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges.

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single instance of an <u>observational unit</u>
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some variables may be used to identify the <u>observational units</u>. 
    + For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## Differentiating between <u>neat</u> data and <u>tidy</u> data

- Colloquially, they mean the same thing
- But in our context, one is a subset of the other. 

<br>

<u>Neat</u> data is 
  - easy to look at, 
  - organized nicely, and 
  - in table form.

--

<u>Tidy</u> data is neat but also abides by a set of three rules.

## Is this tidy?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight)
set.seed(2)
bechdel %>% sample_n(16) %>%
  select(year, title, clean_test, budget_2013) %>%
  arrange(title)
```


---

## Is this tidy?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dem_score <- read_csv("data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```

## Beginning steps

Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to
- check that the data is <u>tidy</u>,
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.

This will help you with 
- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.
